Right now working my way through Bayesian Methods again. Saving useful examples of plots, models and analysis. Find it here https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers. Would highly recommend as good reading for getting started with stats in python
